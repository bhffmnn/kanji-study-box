# Kanji Study Box

## Overview

Kanji Study Box is a (very WIP) desktop application for memorizing kanji by spatial repetition. It works similar to a highly specialized flashcard system (Leitner system).

Instead of using two-sided cards like an actual flashcard system, every kanji is represented as an item with multiple attributes like character, readings and meanings. There are also no boxes as in a real flashcard system, instead study progress is tracked for every kanji individually via levels. This enables individual, automatic scheduling for every single kanji.

The application doesnâ€™t come with study material. As with actual flashcard systems the user has to provide the data. There is, however, an import function for the free kanji dictionary KANJIDIC2, which provides a quick and eays way of loading study data into the application's dictionary. It can be downloaded from https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project.

The application comes with stroke order diagrams that can be displayed during study.

The project uses JavaFX 11 and JDK 11.
